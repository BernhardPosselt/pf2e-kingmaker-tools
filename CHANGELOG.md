  and Forager
* Recipe healing, damaging and condition reducing effects are implemented, automating all remaining recipes
* There is now a way to increase the number of fame points
* Campsite Positions are now remembered on each scene so you can reuse their last result if it wasn't a critical failure

### Removed

* Remove token mappings from GMG npcs to not conflict with NPC Core
* This release marks a departure from Paizo IP to OGL only content due improve licensing compatibility. This primarily
  means that some names and setting information had to be removed or changed (

    * Set your combat tracks and random encounters manually in camping sheet

  to enable them without companion leaders. However, they are not migrated and don't automatically enable invested and
  benefits anymore, when you assign a companion to a leadership position. Enable/Disable them like normally in your turn
  tab. Regarding Octavia, there's a kingdom sheet setting now to enable that benefit
