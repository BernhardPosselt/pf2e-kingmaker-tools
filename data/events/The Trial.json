  "description": "<p>Once the criminal has been arrested, the PCs have the option of putting him on trial during a following Kingdom turn’s Activities phase. As this is a leadership activity, it must be one of the three activities performed during Step 3 of the Activities phase. Each Kingdom turn that passes with the criminal imprisoned without a trial, increase the Kingdom’s Unrest by @gain1d4Unrest and @gain1Corruption. If a Public Scandal random event ever occurs while the criminal is imprisoned, he is released from prison on a technicality and all previous Support Points are zeroed out as he begins to spread propaganda again, starting the whole process over from the start. If a Justice Prevails random event occurs while he’s imprisoned, the criminal is either executed, exiled, or rehabilitated (players’ choice) as part of that event, with the corresponding repercussions as detailed below for a successful trial.</p><p>During the criminal's trial (which lasts for several days over the month), attempt a DC 27 Intrigue, Politics, or Statecraft Kingdom skill check. This DC is equal to the criminal's Deception DC (DC 27). Each PC can attempt to lower this DC with a successful DC 24 Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check, or with a DC 19 Legal Lore check; each success reduces the Kingdom skill check DC by 1 to a maximum reduction of 5 at DC 22.</p>",
