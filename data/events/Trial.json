  "description": "Once the criminal has been arrested, the PCs have the option of putting him on trial during a following Kingdom turn’s Activities phase. As this is a leadership activity, it must be one of the three activities performed during Step 3 of the Activities phase. Each Kingdom turn that passes with the criminal imprisoned without a trial, increase the Kingdom’s Unrest by <button type=\"button\" class=\"km-gain-lose\" data-type=\"unrest\" data-mode=\"gain\" data-turn=\"now\" data-multiple=\"false\" data-value=\"1d4\">Gain 1d4 Unrest</button> and <button type=\"button\" class=\"km-gain-lose\" data-type=\"corruption\" data-mode=\"gain\" data-turn=\"now\" data-multiple=\"false\" data-value=\"1\">Gain 1 Corruption</button>. If a Public Scandal random event ever occurs while the criminal is imprisoned, he is released from prison on a technicality and all previous Support Points are zeroed out as he begins to spread propaganda again, starting the whole process over from the start. If a Justice Prevails random event occurs while he’s imprisoned, the criminal is either executed, exiled, or rehabilitated (players’ choice) as part of that event, with the corresponding repercussions as detailed below for a successful trial.",
