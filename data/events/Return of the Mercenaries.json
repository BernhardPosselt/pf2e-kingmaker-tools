  "description": "<p>After the PCs disrupted the mercenaries' plans and slaughtered several of their lower-ranking members during the raid on the manor, the mercenary killers have seethed and plotted. As word of the PCs’ new nation reaches the neighboring country, the mercenaries take note and send a new group of killers south to infiltrate the kingdom. These mercenaries make their presence known by attempting a very public attack on the kingdom to send a clear message to its leaders: The mercenaries do not forget!</p><p>Once this kingdom event is completed, whether the mercenaries continue to cause periodic trouble for the PCs is left to you to decide. For example, you could link them to some random events like Assassination Attempts, Bandit Activity, Feuds, Public Scandals, Sensational Crimes, and Vandals.</p>",
