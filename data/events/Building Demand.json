If the citizens demand a new structure, the GM chooses one as close to the kingdom’s level as possible, preferably one that decreases Unrest when built. If the citizens demand a structure be demolished, the GM chooses one that best fits the storyline of the campaign, preferably one whose item bonus or other benefits have been rendered obsolete by newer structures. If you are willing to commit each upcoming Civic activity granted by this settlement to attempting the requested Build Structure or Demolish activity until they succeed, you do not attempt the check.",
