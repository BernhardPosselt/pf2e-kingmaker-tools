The type of monster should be chosen by the GM; its level should equal the party’s level + 1 (a Low threat encounter). The PCs can choose to resolve this event with a Kingdom skill check, or they can travel to the hex the monster is rampaging in to challenge it in encounter mode. If they don’t defeat the monster by the end of the next day, treat this event as having a Critical Failure result.",
