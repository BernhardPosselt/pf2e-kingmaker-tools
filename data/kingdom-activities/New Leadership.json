You normally perform this activity at the start of a Kingdom turn, but if unexpected events (such as the death of the character) remove a leader from a leadership role, you may immediately use the New Leadership activity to attempt to assign a new leader to that role, even outside of a Kingdom turn (applying the vacancy penalty for that role as appropriate). Attempt a basic Intrigue, Politics, Statecraft, or Warfare skill check—while any of these skills can be used, each skill is particularly suited to assigning two specific leadership roles.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Intrigue</b>: Grants a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to assign Emissaries and Treasurers.</li>\n<li><b>Politics</b>: Grants a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to assign Counselors and Rulers.</li>\n<li><b>Statecraft</b>: Grants a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to assign Magisters and Viceroys.</li>\n<li><b>Warfare</b>: Grants a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to assign Generals and Wardens.</li>\n</ul><p>Rulers are particularly difficult to assign; when you take this activity to assign a new Ruler, you take a –4 circumstance penalty to the skill check, and unless you achieve a critical success, you <button type=\"button\" class=\"km-gain-lose\" data-type=\"unrest\" data-mode=\"gain\" data-turn=\"now\" data-multiple=\"false\" data-value=\"1\">Gain 1 Unrest</button>. Whether or not you are simultaneously assigning a leader, you may also use this activity to attempt to reselect the four leadership roles that you have invested. Any result other than a critical failure allows this.</p>",
