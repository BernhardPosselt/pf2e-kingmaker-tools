All leaders must spend all of their leadership activities during the Activity phase of a Kingdom turn on this activity. The kingdom leaders announce that they are uprooting the seat of government from its current home and reestablishing it in another settlement. Attempt a check with a DC equal to the kingdom’s Control DC + 5. You cannot Relocate your Capital again for at least 3 Kingdom turns.",
