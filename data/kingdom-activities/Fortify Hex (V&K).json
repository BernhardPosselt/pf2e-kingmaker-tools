Spend RP as determined by the hexâ€™s most inhospitable terrain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Mountains</b>: @lose12ResourcePoints</li>\n<li><b>Swamps</b>: @lose8ResourcePoints</li>\n<li><b>Forests</b>: @lose4ResourcePoints</li>\n<li><b>Hills</b>: @lose2ResourcePoints</li>\n<li><b>Plains</b>: @lose1ResourcePoints</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then attempt a basic check. A fortified hex grants an additional bonus in warfare, but also gives traveling PCs a place to rest that prevents wandering monsters from interrupting their rest.</p>\n<p>The Fortify Hex Activity gives a Hex the Refuge terrain feature. If a Settlement is later established in the Hex, the GM may allow the Refuge to be converted to a free or discounted appropriate Structure, such as a Barracks. Any free Structure should not exceed one Resource Die. For a discounted Structure, the GM can choose how much to discount it but the discount should not be more than one Resource Die and/or two Commodities. The Kingdom must pay any remaining RP and Commodities. The new settlement then starts with the Structure.</p>",
