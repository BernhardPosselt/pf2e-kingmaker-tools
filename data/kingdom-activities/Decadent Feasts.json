And you are no fool; you understand the fear your goddess inspires in the living and knows that focusing on other aspects of her worship are more likely to result in positive growth for the nation. In order to distract the populace, you arrange for decadent feasts for the people, simultaneously feeding the hungry while camouflaging some of your faith’s more sinister aspects. @lose1d8Food and @lose1Luxuries, then attempt a basic Agriculture or Trade check to determine how effective the feasts are.",
