  "notes": "A menagerie typically contains a selection of level 5 or lower animals. If your party captures a living creature of level 6 or higher and can transport the creature back to a settlement with a menagerie, you can add that creature to the menagerie as long as your kingdom level is at least 4 higher than the creature's level. Each time such a creature is added to a menagerie, gain 1 Fame or Infamy point (as appropriate) or reduce one Ruin of your choice by 1.\nOnly creatures with Intelligence modifiers of –4 or –5 are appropriate to place in a menagerie. A kingdom gains 1 Unrest at the start of a Kingdom turn for each sapient creature (anything with an Intelligence modifier of –3 or higher) on display in a menagerie.",
