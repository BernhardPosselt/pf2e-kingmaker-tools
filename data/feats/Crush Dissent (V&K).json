Once per Kingdom turn when you gain Unrest, you can attempt to crush the dissent by attempting a basic Warfare check. On a success, the Unrest increase is canceled, but on a critical failure, the Unrest increase is doubled. In addition, you gain a +1 status bonus to checks to resolve dangerous kingdom events that involve internal bickering, such as Feud.",
