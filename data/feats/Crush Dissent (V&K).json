    "text": "Your rule brooks no dissent and stamps out traitors, making harsh examples of them. Once per Kingdom\nturn when you gain Unrest, you can attempt to crush the dissent by attempting a basic Warfare check. On a success, the Unrest increase is canceled, but on a critical failure, the Unrest increase is doubled. In addition, you gain a +1 status bonus to checks to resolve dangerous kingdom events that involve internal bickering, such as Feud.",
