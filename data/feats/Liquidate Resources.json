    "text": "Your kingdomâ€™s economy can liquidate resources in an emergency when funding runs out. The first time during a Kingdom turn in which you are forced to spend RP as the result of a failed skill check or a dangerous event, and that expense reduces you to 0 RP, you may instead reduce your RP to 1 and treat the expense as if it were paid in full. At the start of your next Kingdom turn, roll 4 fewer Resource Dice than normal."
