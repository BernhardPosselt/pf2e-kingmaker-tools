You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Loyalty-based checks attempted as part of the New Leadership and Pledge of Fealty activities. If you fail or critically fail such a check, you can spend 2 RP to reroll the check (but without the +2 circumstance bonus); attempting this adds the Fortune trait. You must take the result of the second roll, even if it is worse than the original roll.",
