When a leader uses the Focused Attention kingdom activity to aid another leader’s kingdom check, the circumstance bonus granted by a success is increased to +3. At 11th level, your leaders’ collaborative style leads them to ever greater successes when they work together. When a leader uses the Focused Attention kingdom activity to aid another leader’s check, treat a critical failure on the aided check as a failure. If your kingdom has at least the expert rank in the skill used in the aided check, treat a failure on the check as a success. (This does not allow you to ever improve a critical failure to a success.)",
