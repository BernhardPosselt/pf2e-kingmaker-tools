# Tips & House Rules

Spoilers ahead!

## Should You Buy the Companion Guide

The additional rules are hit or miss. If you can't automate Camping, it's horrible. I've dropped weather in my game. The additional quests themselves are mid to good, I've enjoyed Amiri's, Valerie's, Linzi's and Jublilost's quest in particular. You will not get custom quests for 6 out of 13 companions which sucks.

Therefore, I would only recommend buying the book if you want to include the companions from the CRPG.

## General Advice

Kingmaker is huge and uses an incredible amount of subsystems:

* Influence
* Research
* Kingdom Building
* Warfare
* Camping
* Weather

In addition to that, it is one of the very few sandbox adventures that Paizo has put out, which allows a much more free form progression and makes it easy to add in homebrew. If you are just starting out with Pathfinder, this AP is probably the wrong one, and you might be better off playing a more linear AP with fewer subsystems.

Here's some general advice and things you have to think about:

* XP is heavily recommended over milestone. Reason for that is that XP rewards exploration as opposed to reaching certain goals in game. If you run milestone, your players are encouraged to complete main story encounters first, finishing side content super over-leveled, if at all. The AP is much larger than any other adventure, so if you run it without custom content, using 1200XP to reach a new level is a must. Otherwise, go for 1500XP per level. In general, it is easier to err on the side of too much XP, since it's easier to reward RP with XP than to "steal" XP from encounters. Players won't like that.
* Regions have a certain level of difficulty. There are almost no Extreme encounters in this book, so it's generally safe for PCs to explore an area which is +1 above their level. If your players want to venture into higher regions, you should warn them by giving them information their characters might know about creatures and dangers in that area. You can also block off certain parts with armies, e.g. anything east of the Narlmarches.
* Do not include companions in combat, unless you are playing with 3 or fewer players. In that case, it might be fun to let the remaining players level them up and include them in their load-out for the recommended 4 player party. Keep in mind that you will need to keep them viable on the magic item side.
* You can skip various subsystems if you don't like them:
    * **Camping**: might slow down hexploration and might be boring for your players, especially if it isn't automated; use the Fortify Camp hexploration activity instead and roll 1 encounter per watch
    * **Weather**: will TPK your party RAW and not add much apart from easily healed damage; if you skip it, use the Environment rules from the GMG instead
    * **Kingdom Building**: If you don't put in work to add flavor, tangible benefits, lore and RP plus ramp up the pressure using Unrest and Ruin in certain parts, or decrease the difficulty by handing out too many bonuses, this will feel like managing an Excel spreadsheet. If you skip it, keep the Kingdom Events, those are a special treat
    * **Warfare**: Combat might be too abstract since a lot of depth is dropped. Plays similar to other narrative RPGs with quick combat. If you skip it, keep the flavor and RP, but let the PCs fight enemy generals. If you run Kingdom Building, I recommend keeping it since it improves its mechanics by a lot
* Players have access to horses early on to bump their speed to 40ft. You should let players know that they can do that.
* Random Combat Encounters, as written, are too frequent. I'd recommend a 50/50 split between combat and RP. RP encounters might include meeting travelers that let them know rumors or uncover interesting hexes, merchants that allow them to buy a special magic item, PCs contracting a disease of their level or lower or encounters that let you disclose lore or foreshadow events
* Be wary of Restov and loot in the early chapters. Loot balance in the early levels in general is way above the recommendations in the CRB. This isn't an issue if you prevent players from buying items above their level, but you don't want to make your structures less useful that bump those levels
* In general, the Stolen Lands map is densely populated with encounters in the first 4 levels, but after that, it drops off significantly. You want to add more stuff to make exploration feel rewarding. You don't need to add something to every hex, but in general I'd recommend to populate most hexes with interesting encounters. Here are some ideas:
    * Formulas for uncommon/rare/unique items in the form of broken items, plans, books or descriptions that can be deciphered using Decipher Writing
    * Additional resources like Rocks, abandoned Worksites, Wood, Ruins, Structures, Precious Materials, Merchants, Trainers, enemy armies
    * Additional Landmarks and Refuges
    * Commodities like Lumber, Ore, etc
* You need to give players a time limit to complete chapters, but don't forget to give them plenty time in between chapters to develop their kingdom and perform downtime activities. Without time constraints, travel costs are completely invalidated which in turn also makes roads, bridges and travel speed irrelevant. Some suggestions:
    * 3 months to deal with the Stag Lord, otherwise Brevoy might claim the Rostland Hinterlands, cutting the PCs off of fertile farmland. There is no way that a call for adventurers has gone unnoticed and Surtova wants to prevent Khavortorov from tipping the scales. Foreshadow by letting them meet agents from Brevoy.
    * Use weekly **Troll Sightings** events until Hargulka is dealt with. This should give PCs enough urgency to deal with him quickly
    * Similarly, roll one cult event per day, even if PCs have not researched anything during the **Season of Bloom**
    * During the **Varnhold Vanishing**, acting fast could determine if the PCs save Maegar Varn and other citizens before they are killed. This might net the PCs additional loot and structures.
    * Blood for Blood should threaten the PCs with frequent army attacks until they've dealt with Drelev and the Tiger Lords. You can increase the difficulty of the army combats if required. Armies aren't used too frequently in this chapter, because the original AP needed more time to develop the army rules. You should add in additional ones.
    * TBD - haven't reached these yet

### House Rules

* Players can not buy items above their level in Restov: the loot in the early game is out of control and potentially allows players to shop in a 9th level settlement with 6000 gold at level 1. If you are going to allow them to buy items in Restov, you are going to imbalance fights for around half of the AP. In addition, giving players access to purchasing all items in a simple way will remove a lot of reasons why they want to build structures that increase purchasable item levels and will also hamper crafting
* Rations have 1 bulk instead of L bulk or expire after 2 weeks: as mentioned before, the amount of gold your players can get is kinda crazy and rations are cheap. If you do not limit rations in some way, your players will never need to interact with the survival systems at lower levels
* All Precious Materials are uncommon: this allows PCs to find resources on the world map and gain access to them when they claim the hexes
* Horses are usually Large, so carrying items of medium bulk will halve their bulk values (L -> negligible, 1 -> L, 2 -> 1, etc). To somewhat limit the insane amount of storage, I'd recommend to max out their bulk capacity at 6 bulk.
* No random combat encounters are rolled in claimed hexes

## Weather

This subsystem has been hugely disappointing. RAW, weather events can happen up to level 5 with a level 1 party, TPKing a party immediately if you roll a nasty event. At higher levels, this just deals damage that can immediately be healed. I recommend using the [core rules for environments](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=590) instead: weather changes terrain cost during encounters and potentially applies visibility penalties like concealed, penalties to ranged attacks, cold weather deals damage without proper equipment, etc.

## Hexploration

There is no point in slowing down exploration any further, so I recommend to not add any more activities on top of Travel and Reconnoiter.
**Map the Area** is an activity that makes sense in heavily obscured and difficult terrain which does not exist in this AP, **Fortify
Camp** is basically replaced by camping, so drop both of these activities.

Furthermore, I recommend not rolling secret checks for hidden encounters. You've prepped content for it. Nothing sucks more than skipping an interesting encounter because your players have failed a Perception check. The only time this makes sense is if you want players to discover and deal with an encounter prior to when it should happen, e.g. they might discover lairs of beasts that might threaten their kingdom before it attacks. Another use case could be as a time sink in time critical parts of the game, but then they need to know that something hidden exists in the hex.

### House Rules

* Omit the **Map the Area** and **Fortify Camp** Hexploration Activities
* Do not roll secret checks to notice hidden encounters unless it has interesting consequences
* Increase the Travel activity cost by 1 degree (up to a maximum of 3) if PCs are travelling through a hex with a river and no bridge: makes constructing bridges actually useful
* Hexes containing a settlement reduce their Travel cost to 1 if you've constructed Paved Streets: makes Paved Streets useful

## Camping

Camping should be quick and easy but as written can bog down the game massively. The rules do not mention it very clearly, but you are supposed to only take 4 activities in total, meaning: companions do not perform their activities on top of the PCs' automatically.

### House Rules

* You do not need to make a camp in your own lands and automatically succeed at cooking a meal: speeds up the game and rewards claiming land
* You can perform a number of camping activities equal to the number of PCs: prevents players from feeling left out
* You can not perform other activities during **Prepare Campsite**: prevents analysis paralysis during setup
* Camping Activities are performed at the same time: no need to worry about the sequence of events happening
* Each companion can only be influenced or discovered once per camping sessions: prevents players ganging up on companions and maxing out their influence in the first couple sessions
* Only 1 encounter is rolled during your watch and camping activities don't increase the DC: too many random encounters can bog down your session; if you don't check for random encounters, many camping activities are obsolete and there's no tension
* All camping activity buffs apply to everyone at the start of the camping session: simplifies and speeds up the game
* Regongar's activity does not grant XP: there is already enough XP as is, no need to reward PCs for choosing the lazy way out
* Crafting an item is a camping activity: there's already a lot of downtime in this AP (years), so this gives them a bit more flexibility to craft all those items that they find formulas for (**Note**: this might conflict with the building requirements to craft items)

#### Random Encounters

When a random encounter happens, people that are awake perform a Perception check against the ambusher's Stealth DC. Everyone else is unconscious, sleeping in their tents with their armor removed (unless it has the comfort trait).

* **Critical Success**: As Success but PCs are not prone and have reactions
* **Success**: As Failure but sleeping PCs wake up, gaining the prone condition
* **Failure**: As Critical Failure but Enemies start within 60ft distance
* **Critical** Failure: Enemies start within 15ft distance of PCs. Sleeping PCs are unconscious and do not gain Reactions before their turn starts

PCs can be woken up, gaining the prone condition when:

* They take damage
* They get shaken awake with a touch interact action
* They beat a Perception check at the start of their turn. DC:
    * 10: very loud noises like gun shots
    * 15: loud noises like swords clashing, spells being cast or shouting using 1 action with the auditory trait
    * 20: medium noises like PCs getting hit with weapons
    * Monster's Stealth DC otherwise

If they do not wake up, they skip their turn.

## Kingdom Management

This might be the most labor-intensive system in this AP. If you run it as written, it will be terrible. Imagine cutting your sessions in half to play a heavy Euro board game without any real impact. You as a GM need to do the heavy lifting to make it feel worth it. You need to provide tangible rewards for players to build structures, you need to make them feel like they are building a kingdom by adding in RP events and story for building structures or performing kingdom activities, and you need to make that solo Euro board game fun by ramping up the difficulty. Kingdom Events should always tie into recent activities/actions: PC chose to Infiltrate an enemy faction? That political scandal is there way of getting back at you. PCs constructed a shrine in their town? They might need to recruit a priest in the Kamelands who abandoned their faith.

Mechanically, [Vance & Kerenshara's](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NHksCXkXbjtrv-26VgFHNbyYldatVwag9lM44IWxIXo/edit?usp=sharing) rules are a good starting point to patch up the rough mechanical parts, but I've found that you don't want to add all recommended changes. Specifically, giving players additional ability boosts and skill proficiencies might be better as a quest rewards that are given out slowly over the course of the adventure, if at all.

If you give your players too many proficiencies or boosts, you will prevent Unrest and Ruin from accumulating: these 2 things are the only way to create tension in the first half of the adventure and will actually make using Leadership Activities fun. Players can always take **Supernatural Solution** to deal with emergencies. Don't accidentally remove these tools from your arsenal!

Furthermore, giving your players the ability to reconnoiter a hex using an activity will remove a lot of the fun of exploring the Stolen Lands, so I'd advise against that.

We've also discovered an additional issue: V&K significantly boosts kingdom XP at lower levels. This makes the subsystem bearable but you will lack enough region activities to grab additional hexes and construct settlements and worksites. To account for that, I'm currently testing the following Leadership Activity:

### House Rules

* PCs can attempt the same Activity multiple times unless it's specifically forbidden: the rules aren't super clear on this, this seems to be the RAI and prevents players from running out of things to do.
* Increase XP gains and milestones similar to the Vance & Karenshara house rules: the amount of rounds it takes to gain a kingdom level is out of whack at low levels; these rules will level up your kingdom roughly every 5 turns. To account for fewer Region Activities, add the following activity:
    * **Naval Support**: You use your fleet to ship materials or transport skilled builders and specialists to where they are needed most. Attempt a basic Boating check.
        * **Critical Success**: You gain 2 additional region activities.
        * **Succcess**: You gain 1 additional region activity.
        * **Failure**: You gain 1 additional region activity by investing additional funds. Lose 2d6 RP
        * **Critical Failure**: You do not gain an additional region activity and lose 2d6 RP
* Use the adjusted buildings from Vance & Kerenshara
* Additional Skill Increases like in Vance & Kerenshara: many buildings are proficiency gated; having very few increases takes the fun out of that
* All players, regardless of group size, get a total of 8 Leadership activities or 12 with a Townhall, Castle or Palace: if you give out too many activities, it will be harder to pressure them with Unrest or Ruin during the Season of Bloom
* Decrease the Ruin Threshold from 10 to 5: Ruin is an absolute joke right now and dealing with Unrest and Ruin actually makes Leadership activities fun
* Ruins and Structures are incorporated into settlements automatically if they are in the settlement's influence: Many structures are way too close to your settlements to warrant building yet another settlement nearby
* Settlements can't grow beyond 36 blocks: this lets you use an existing settlement map for the entire game

### Additional Milestones

My players asked for additional rewards for completing these:

* Connecting a settlement to your capital via roads: 50XP
* Claiming all hexes in a region: 200XP

### Structures

To make kingdom building fun, structures should not only give a flat bonus to a skill, but also provide the PCs themselves benefits, that they could not have gotten otherwise. Also think of additional quests or RP encounters that might be unlocked by building a structure, e.g. a specialized artisan, that might forge a single weapon for a PC.

#### Trainers

The following buildings allow you to retrain:

* **Shrine**: Cleric, Oracle
* **Library**: Investigator, Thaumaturge, Psychic
* **Alchemy Laboratory**: Alchemist, Gunslinger, Inventor
* **Tavern**: Bard
* **Arcanist's Tower**: Wizard, Witch, Sorcerer, Magus
* **Garrison**: Fighter, Barbarian, Champion, Monk
* **Sacred Grove**: Druid, Kineticist, Summoner, Ranger
* **Thieves' Guild**: Rogue
* **Pier**: Swashbuckler

#### Crafting

The following buildings give you access to crafting items:

* **Smithy/Foundry**: metallic items
* **Stonemason**: runes
* **Tannery**: leather
* **Arcanist Tower**: scrolls, wands & staves
* **Luxury store**: amulets and rings
* **Library**: tomes
* **Alchemy Laboratory**: alchemical items
* **Lumberyard**: wooden items
* **Specialized artisan**: other

#### Temple & Cathedral

My players chose to run low skill, low intelligence PCs, so performing the **Resurrect** ritual is really tough. This makes kingdom structures more useful as well, so it's a win-win:

* Temple gives you a +1 status bonus to perform rituals
* Cathedral gives you a +2 status bonus to perform rituals

#### Aiudara Gate (Level 10, rare)

The system currently punishes you for building structures with item bonuses outside your capital. This building allows players to create specialized settlements and rewards them for continuing to build settlements in strategic points. Rare, so you can give your players access to the blueprints whenever you feel like it. Needless to say, you should not give players access to the **Teleport** spell

* **Lots**: 1 **Cost**: 50 RP, 15 Stone, 4 Lumber, 2 Luxuries
* **Construction**: Magic (expert) DC 27
* **Item Bonuses**: +3 to Relocate Capital
* **Effects**: Settlements with an Aiudara Gate allow you to travel to another settlement without delay. Furthermore, if you are in a city with a gate, you can perform your Kingdom Activities in any town. Armies are too large to move them through gates effectively.

#### Companion Shacks/Rooms/Quarters

There are no buildings that provide item bonuses to companion Leadership Activities

**Shacks (level 2)**:

* **Lots**: 1 **Cost** 4 RP, 4 Lumber, 4 Stone
* **Construction**: Engineering DC 16
* **Upgrades to**: Companion Lodges
* **Item Bonuses**: +1 to All Companion Activities
* **Effects**: You can only build one of these

**Rooms (level 9)**:

* **Lots**: 2 **Cost** 30 RP, 10 Lumber, 10 Stone
* **Construction**: Engineering DC 26
* **Upgrades to**: Companion Chambers
* **Upgrades from**: Companion Shacks
* **Item Bonuses**: +2 to All Companion Activities
* **Effects**: You can only build one of these

**Quarters (level 15)**:

* **Lots**: 4 **Cost** 45 RP, 10 Lumber, 20 Stone, 15 Luxuries
* **Construction**: Engineering DC 34
* **Upgrades from**: Companion Lodges
* **Item Bonuses**: +3 to All Companion Activities

### Additional Leadership Activities

#### Cleanse Item

Kingmaker throws a lot of cursed items at the players with detrimental effects. It can be fun to let them remove an item's downsides.

You can remove curses from an item using a successful Magic counteract check. Your counteract level is your (kingdom level / 2) rounded up and the DC is an incredibly hard (+10) DC based on the item's level. In addition, you need to pay luxuries and have access to specific structures to prepare the ritual based on the item's level:

* **1-5**: 1 Luxury, Shrine
* **6-10**: 2 Luxuries, Temple
* **11-15**: 4 Luxuries, Temple
* **16-20**: 8 Luxuries, Cathedral

---

* **Critical Success**: You remove the curse from the item, including any negative effects (up to the GM) and expend half of the materials
* **Success**: You remove the curse from the item, including any negative effects (up to the GM)
* **Critical Failure**: You permanently destroy the item

## Armies

Armies right now have 1 glaring issue: they lack restrictions other than consuming food.

### House Rules

* The number of armies is limited by your settlements: this rewards creating additional settlements and filling them with structures:
    * **Town**: 1
    * **City**: 2
    * **Metropolis**: 3
* Armies are grouped together as divisions. Each division can hold up to n armies, where n is equal to the number of players: this will give each player an army to run in combat to keep them engaged
* No more than 1 division of each faction can be present in any hex at any time: this prevents players from overwhelming an enemy by sheer number of armies. Think of it as preventing the players from running all companions in combats balanced for 4 PCs. If you don't do that, you can't balance battles at all, which makes army combat incredibly boring. Furthermore, it will prevent you from pulling your hair out when stacking tokens on the world map.
* You can not deploy armies, only Divisions. The same applies to Offensive Gambit and Recovering lost armies. If your armies are affected by conditions, combine their modifiers and use the highest/lowest one: this will move all armies as a unit, preventing players from being left out of the fun if you fail a single Deploy Army check.
