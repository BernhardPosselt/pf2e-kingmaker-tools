Testing TODOs:

* macros

Test feedback:
* I like the macros to open the kingdom and camping sheets.  Are these macros no longer available?
* The roll dialog is confusing me.  I get both Leadership (Specialized) and Leadership (Unspecialized), not one or the other, and they don't seem to coorrespond the kingdom skills matrix.  For example, Establish Farmland takes Agriculture, which is only checkboxed for Viceroy and Warden.  But I get the Leadership (Specialized) and Leadership (Unspecialized) for Counselor, Emissary, General, Treasurer, Viceroy, and Warden.  When I checkbox Magister, the behavior doesn't change.
* I'm unable to get the settlement levels to register, they always show 0.  The residences show up, e.g. 0 (4), and all the structures show up in the details box, and shopping tab and bonus tab seems to be right (other than no settlement level).  Lacks Bridge seems stuck on even though there are no water borders.  Overcrowded is also always on.
