They land before the PCs and, pretending to serve Nyrissa, imperiously demand to know why the PCs have intruded upon Thousand Voices. Of course, they know well who the PCs are by reputation, unless they’ve taken pains to disguise themselves—the vilderavn wants the PCs to succeed at building their kingdom so Nyrissa can absorb it and thus complete her apology to their master, the Lantern King; the vilderavn, of course, reveals none of this to the party. Instead, they encourage the PCs to “return to their realm and see to its needs; this woodland is not yours for the taking.” The vilderavn attacks if attacked first, or if the PCs refuse to turn back and leave the forest behind. If combat breaks out, the vilderavn and their zomok mount work to drive the PCs out or incapacitate them rather than kill them; they want the PCs to survive and finish building their kingdom, after all! Only one of these emissaries patrols the forest; if they are slain, this encounter won’t occur again. Likewise, once Chapter 10 begins and Nyrissa has started the process of absorbing the PCs’ kingdom, the emissary’s role here is no longer needed—in this case, this encounter is with the wild hunt instead.","img":"icons/svg/d20-black.svg","documentId":null,"flags":{}},{"type":0,"weight":1,"range":[20,20],"drawn":false,"documentCollection":"","_id":"5J9mprkcIdP91X5J","text":"1 @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.VUJrPHKOjYkIQnWn]{Mu Spore} (Severe 18)","img":"icons/svg/d20-black.svg","documentId":null,"flags":{}}],"formula":"1d20","replacement":true,"displayRoll":true,"ownership":{"default":0,"oxLvfZiIFxns2JLx":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"kingmaker","system":"pf2e","coreVersion":"10.291","systemVersion":"4.4.2"},"core":{"sourceId":"RollTable.00e1jC3T6cMLZd4h"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.4.2","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1670798045298,"modifiedTime":1670817693048,"lastModifiedBy":"oxLvfZiIFxns2JLx"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"00e1jC3T6cMLZd4h"}
