    <h1>Armies</h1>
    <h2>IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER</h2>
    <p>Army statblocks are implemented as NPC actors which use unlinked token actors. This means that changing the actor
        in the sidebar will propagate all changes to all existing tokens, unless the token has specifically overriden a
        value.
        This implies the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Adding a tactic to an army actor in the sidebar will add it to all token copies on all scenes</li>
        <li>Changing values like level on a token will prevent it from being leveled up automatically when changing the
            actor level on an actor in the sidebar
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Army Statblocks</h2>
    <p>Armies are implemented as NPC stat blocks because attacks and rule elements already work like out of the box. The
        following stats are present in the following locations:</p>

    <h2>Automation Notes</h2>
    <p>Kingdom Sheet:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Any conditions that apply to Army Activities do not gain modifiers in the Kingdom sheet</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Homebrew Errata</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Guard</b>: This action reads very similar to <b>Raise Shield</b> yet gives you an item bonus instead
            of a circumstance bonus. This action therefore becomes absolute once you obtain +2 armor. This was changed
            to a circumstance bonus instead
        </li>
        <li><b>Wyvern Flight</b>: Changed attack modifier to 26 instead of way too low 18</li>
        <li><b>Lizardfolk Defenders</b>: Changed attack modifier from 12 to 15 since there were no adjusted stats</li>
        <li><b>M'Botuu Frog Riders</b>: Changed ac from 27 to 30 since there were no adjusted stats</li>
        <li><b>Tatzlford Town Guard</b>: Hold the Line tactic reduces Rout Threshold to 1 instead of the listed 2</li>
    </ul>
